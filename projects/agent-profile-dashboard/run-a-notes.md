# Run A — Notes

Accumulating log of decisions, DS deviations, operating-principles citations, and surfaced findings across the Run A phases. Phase 4 will consolidate; phases 2–3 append as they go.

## Phase 2 fix — activity-state bug and budget window (commit `389f8105`)

### Decisions

- **Activity-state is derived, not read.** The hero activity pill resolves state via a derived `activityStatus` that prefers agent-level terminal states (paused, pending_approval, terminated) first, then looks at the `runs` array to detect running/queued heartbeats, and only falls through to raw `agent.status` for other cases. This guarantees the pill agrees with the Live Run card — both read the same source of truth for "is the agent running right now."
  - *Lens — Mental Models:* users expect the header indicator and the live card to tell the same story; any disagreement is a trust-break.
  - *Lens — Postel's Law:* tolerate imperfect backend signals (stale `agent.status` cache) by deriving from a signal that's always fresh.

### DS deviations

None introduced in this phase. Only used tokens + raw-palette classes that already existed in the dashboard region.

### Surfaced findings (not fixed — flagged for later)

- **Cache-key mismatch for agent.status live-event invalidation** (`ui/src/context/LiveUpdatesProvider.tsx:816` vs `ui/src/pages/AgentDetail.tsx:655`). The detail query keys on the URL-ref (`"conversation-tester"`) plus company-id; the live-event invalidation passes the UUID. React Query's prefix match fails. Derivation sidesteps the symptom; the underlying cache-coherence issue remains. Out of scope for Run A — flagging for a follow-up cleanup.

## Phase 3a — Hero module redesign

### Decisions

- **50/50 hero split, not 55/45.** Smoke test feedback: right zone felt cramped at 55/45. Switched to `grid-cols-2`. Both zones now have matched visual weight; right zone has breathing room for the budget card and recent-runs strip without eating vertical space.
  - *Lens — Common Region (Gestalt):* equal widths reinforce "now" vs. "how are we doing" as parallel questions, not subordinate ones. A 55/45 treatment whispered "the left is more important" when in fact both zones carry Section-1-critical signals.

- **Cyan relocated, not preserved at card level.** The Live Run card no longer renders `border-cyan-500/30` + glow shadow. The activity-state pill carries the liveness signal externally; the internal `StatusIcon` (cyan spinning `Loader2` when running) carries it locally. This eliminates the three-way cyan duplication that existed in Phase 2 (pill + card border + internal spinner).
  - *Lens — Von Restorff:* isolation works only when the isolated signal is alone. The pill is now the single chromatic "alive" signal at the top of the hero. The internal spinner is a secondary local signal, small enough not to compete.
  - *Lens — Information Scent:* the pill's position (top-left, where the eye lands first per F-pattern) is the right place for the liveness signal; burying it in a card border is noise, not signal.

- **LatestRunCard header row removed.** The previous "Live Run / Latest Run" heading plus separate "View details →" link were redundant with the activity pill above and the `StatusBadge` inside the card. The card is now a single `Link` — click anywhere navigates to run detail. `aria-label` carries the context for screen readers.
  - *Lens — Fitts's Law:* the whole card as a click target is larger and faster than an isolated text link.
  - *Lens — Recognition over Recall:* the `StatusBadge` inside the card tells the user what kind of card it is without requiring a separate heading.

- **Idle-state "Next up" hint.** When the activity status is `idle` or `active` (i.e., the agent is waiting, not running), the left zone renders a small forward-looking line below the Latest Run card: either `Next up · <task-id> <title> →` (linking to the top in-flight task) or `No pending work` (when there are zero in-flight tasks). This answers "what's supposed to happen next?" for the monitoring user, which the concept §1 flagged as a missing signal.
  - *Lens — Goal-Gradient + Zeigarnik:* an idle agent with pending work should surface that work cheaply; users resolve faster when they see the next step.
  - *Lens — Serial Position:* primary item (`inFlightTasks[0]`, highest priority by existing sort) earns the "Next up" slot; the full list is one scroll away.
  - *Data scope:* the forward-looking signal is derived from `inFlightTasks` (already computed in `AgentOverview`). A richer signal ("Next scheduled run in 12m") would require fetching routines, which is out of scope for this dashboard.

- **Recent-runs strip uses icons, not dots.** The seven recent runs are now rendered as colored lucide icons from `runStatusIcons` (`CheckCircle2`, `XCircle`, `Loader2`, `Clock`, etc.) at `h-3.5 w-3.5`, not colored dots. Each icon is a `<Link>` to the run detail, with `aria-label` and `title` carrying the status + relative time.
  - *Lens — WCAG POUR (color-independence):* icons are shape-distinguished, so colorblind users can parse outcomes without relying on color. Hover/focus tooltip + aria-label provide the full context.
  - *Implementation note:* the Phase 2 `tone.color.replace(/text-/g, "bg-")` hack is gone. LucideIcons use `currentColor`, so the parent link's `tone.color` class propagates cleanly.

- **Activity-pill text color.** Text is `text-foreground` by default, overridden to `text-cyan-600 dark:text-cyan-400` when running and `text-red-600 dark:text-red-400` on error. These specific classes are already present in the dashboard region (`runStatusIcons` at `AgentDetail.tsx:104–111`), so no new raw-palette drift. Paused/pending_approval/terminated use the default foreground text — the colored dot carries the severity.

### DS deviations — "pass with explicit justification"

None of these are DS violations; they are deliberate choices that may look like deviations on cursory review.

- **`rounded-full` on progress-bar track and activity-dot.** Sharp-corners default (`rounded-none`) applies to surfaces; a progress-bar fill and a 2px status dot are not surfaces — they're glyphs. `rounded-full` is the conventional shape for both and matches `BudgetPolicyCard`'s progress bar and the existing `agentStatusDot` usage elsewhere. Not flagged as rounded-corner drift.
- **Progress bar colors remain `bg-red-400 / bg-amber-300 / bg-emerald-300`.** These are raw-palette classes; the concept §3 suggested `--signal-success` for OK state. Decision: match `BudgetPolicyCard` exactly so the dashboard progress bar and the Budget tab card read as one coherent family. Switching to `--signal-success` locally would split the budget visual vocabulary. The rubric Section 5 "no new tokens" bans proposing tokens mid-experiment; using an existing-but-suboptimal pattern beats forking.
- **`bg-cyan-400` pulse on the activity-state dot** comes from `agentStatusDot["running"]` — unchanged from Phase 0 baseline, used consistently across the app (Agents list, Design Guide showcase).

### Surfaced findings

- **`agentStatusDot["idle"]` and `agentStatusDot["paused"]` are both `bg-yellow-400`.** Distinct states, identical dot color — this is an existing DS ambiguity, not something Phase 3a introduced. Users who check the pill can still read the label text ("Idle" vs "Paused"), but the dot alone is not state-distinguishing between these two. Flagging for a future `status-colors.ts` review; modifying the map is out of scope per the rubric.
- **`active` label renders as "Active" with green dot.** This is the pre-first-heartbeat state. The label is informative but uncommon; most users see `running` / `idle` / `paused`. No change needed.
- **Idle-hint visibility overlaps with In-flight tasks list.** The "Next up · top-task →" line in the hero points to the same top task that appears at the top of the in-flight list below. That's intentional — the hint is a *tip* for monitoring users who don't need to scroll, the list below is the full surface. `Progressive Disclosure` in action; not redundancy.
- **Zero-runs state** renders a plain "No runs yet" card in the left zone + the recent-runs strip collapses to "No runs yet." Both reads together communicate "this agent has no history at all" — fine, but two copies of the same empty-state message. Could consolidate in a future pass; not blocking.

### Tensions / open questions for the Phase 3a checkpoint

1. **Is the LatestRunCard without a heading clear enough?** Removing the "Live Run"/"Latest Run" heading flattens hierarchy but removes a piece of context. If the smoke test finds it ambiguous, we can restore a minimal inline label without reintroducing the pulse dot or separate link.
2. **Budget card zero-state.** At 0% utilization the filled div has `width: 0%`, so the track reads as empty. The "0%" label and "$0.00 of $N.NN" text still communicate the state in copy. No minimum-fill treatment was added — that would fake data. Flagging in case the visual impression of "empty track" reads as broken to the smoke test.
3. **Activity-pill presence.** Current treatment is minimal (dot + text, no pill container). The concept called it a "pill" but meant "status indicator" semantically. If you want more visual presence (padded container, subtle background), say so and I'll iterate. `Aesthetic-Usability Effect` says minimal is probably right here — decoration without function adds noise.
